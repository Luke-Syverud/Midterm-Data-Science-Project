This file was created as part of a midterm project studying multiple trends across Netflix viewership. I chose to focus on movie and tv show ratings in North America and Asia, as well as the duration of TV shows released in North America and Asia. Finally, I looked at movie release years throughout the last decade. I hoped to gain an understanding of the differences in media consumption across both continents, while studying two different mediums of media. I utilized Posit cloud and R to create this project, focusing on data analysis and data visualization.
